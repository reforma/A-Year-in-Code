    <h3> A New Years Resolution</h3>
    <p> I have been trying to learn to code for about a year now off and on and now in 2017 its time to be serious about this!</p>
    <p>Sadly its 03/01/2017 and i only had the idea today so im a little late but lets gloss over that part</p>
    <H3>The Aim</H3>
    <p>I plan to code 250 days this year and to prove ive done it i will be committing these changes daily to Git Hub (to be set up)</p>
    <P> each day i will focus on somthing new and use things that i have learned that day - so for example today Day 1 i have set up the basic HTML page</p>
    <p> we all have to start somewhere ...  git check </p>
