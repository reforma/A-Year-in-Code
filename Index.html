    <p> A website by William Reed</p>

<!-- Introduction -->

  <Div> First Post of 2017</div>
    <h3> A New Years Resolution</h3>
    <p> I have been trying to learn to code for about a year now off and on and now in 2017 its time to be serious about this!</p>
    <p>Sadly its 03/01/2017 and i only had the idea today so im a little late but lets gloss over that part</p>
    <H3>The Aim</H3>
    <p>I plan to code 250 days this year and to prove ive done it i will be committing these changes daily to Git Hub (to be set up)</p>
    <P> each day i will focus on somthing new and use things that i have learned that day - so for example today Day 1 i have set up the basic HTML page</p>
    <p> we all have to start somewhere ...</p>

<div id="Html-Framework">
  <h2>Html Framework</h2>
  <p>So day one ... it begins. Im excited to be doing this it feels like i have a purpose to learning all of this and im really keen to use some of what i have learnt</p>
  <p>This is a very basic framework and i will be adding some CSS and JavaScript to make it a bit more dynamic in coming weeks</p>
<div>

<Div id="Git-commands">
<H2> Git Commands </h2>
  <p> I love the idea of Git Hub its such a cleaver system. I have been using the website version for bits of code from time to time. But i havent really been using it properly. so with the start of this
    project i decided to do things properly.
    <h5>Key Commands<h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Git Init</li>
        <p>Navigate to your Directory with cd path, then use Git Init to start the repro in the directory</p>
        <li>Git Fetch repro https://</li>
        <p>This Fetches the file from the git hub server</p>
        <li>Git Commit</li>
        <p>This shows the files that have changed since last checked in or commits the changes you have added to the commit with Git Add</p>
        <li>Git Add</li>
        <p>This adds files to the commit</p>
        <li>Git Push</li>
        <p>This pushes the code to the server</p>
        <p>In some cases I have needed to use Git -set --upstream then the Https:/
        <li>Git Branch</li>
        <p>If you just use this it lists the Branches, if you add a new branch name after it will create a new branch</p>
        <p>To delete a branch use git branch -d "Branch Name"</p>
        <li>Git Checkout</li>
        <p>This selects whichever branch that you want to modify</p>
        <li>git ls-tree -r "Branch Name"</li>
        <p>this will list the files in the branch</p>
